#TestLink Java API examples

This is a simple project created while answering questions on a certain 
issue in SourceForge.net. Here you can open issues and ask for examples 
of existing methods in the TestLink Java API.

Only requests for examples will be attended here, bugs or features 
requests for the Java API must be reported in SF.net.

The examples are always created with JUnit, as unit tests.
